**Fastly empowers anyone that builds stuff on the internet.**

Across all kinds of organizations, we help make apps, websites and connected devices, faster, safer, and more engaging. We power [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/), the [Linux foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/), downloads of [cURL](https://curl.se/), registries like [Rubygems](https://rubygems.org/) and [PiPi](https://pypi.org/), and public CDNs like [JSDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/) and [polyfill.io](https://polyfill.io).

At Fastly, open source is a part of our heritage, essential to our operations, and central to our future.  Our core technology is built on open-source code, and we use and contribute to the open source technologies and open internet standards that make the modern internet.

To nurture and support those who share our vision of an open internet that is fast and secure for all, we extend free services to eligible open source projects and nonprofits that support them.
