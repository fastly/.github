**Fastly empowers everyone to build the good internet together.**

With features ranging from DDoS and bot protection to caching and edge computing, we help make apps, websites, and connected devices faster, safer, and more engaging.  We power [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), the [Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/), downloads of [cURL](https://curl.se/), registries like [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/) and [PyPi](https://pypi.org/), public CDNs like [JSDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/), and much more. We're BFFs with your refrigerator and your favorite news site.

At Fastly, open source is a part of our heritage, essential to our operations, and central to our future.  Our core technologies are built on open-source code, and we use and contribute to the software and open internet standards that make the modern internet.
