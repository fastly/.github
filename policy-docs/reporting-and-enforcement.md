This document describes the procedures the Fastly OSS governance group uses to enforce the Code of Conduct.

Fastly’s OSS governance group exists to help people work and build things together, and the Code of Conduct exists to help people be and feel safe in our physical and digital spaces. As such, our community should feel safe making Code of Conduct violation reports no matter the severity of the infraction. We will take strong action when needed. When it’s not, we will help people understand how to better engage in the community.

**If you believe someone is in physical danger, including from themselves**, the most important thing is to get that person help. Please contact the appropriate crisis number, non-emergency number, or police number. If you are in a Fastly-sponsored conference or meeting, you can consult with a volunteer or staff member to help find an appropriate number.

## Summary of processes

When the group receives a report of a possible Code of Conduct violation, it will:

 0. Acknowledge receipt of the report.
 1. Evaluate conflicts of interest.
 2. Call a meeting of group members without a conflict of interest.
 3. Evaluate the reported incident.
 4. Propose a behavioral modification plan.
 5. Propose consequences for the reported behavior.
 6. Vote on the behavioral modification plan and consequences for the reported person.
 8. Follow up with the reported person.
 9. Decide further responses.
 10. Follow up with the reporter.

## Making a report

The best way to contact the Fastly OSS governance group is by email at **<oss-governance@fastly.com>**. 

Review [Fastly’s Privacy Policy](https://www.fastly.com/privacy/).

### Report data

When you make a report via email or phone, please include:

* Your contact info (so we can get in touch with you if we need to follow up)
* Date and time of the incident
* Location of incident
* Whether the incident is ongoing
* Description of the incident
* Identifying information of the reported person: name, physical appearance, height, clothing, voice accent, identifying badge information such as company name, ribbons, or badge number
* Additional circumstances surrounding the incident
* Other people involved in or witnesses to the incident and their contact information or description

Please provide as much information as possible.

### Confidentiality

**All reports will be kept confidential**. When we discuss incidents with people who are reported, we will anonymize details as much as we can to protect reporter privacy.

However, some incidents happen in one-on-one interactions, and even if the details are anonymized, the reported person may be able to guess who made the report. If you have concerns about retaliation or your personal safety, please note those in your report. We still encourage you to report, so that we can support you while keeping our conference attendees safe. In some cases, we can compile several anonymized reports into a pattern of behavior, and take action on that pattern.

In some cases we may determine that a public statement is necessary. If that’s the case, the identities of all victims and reporters will remain confidential unless those individuals instruct us otherwise.

### Report handling procedure

When you make a report to the governance group, we will gather information about the incident.

If the incident is ongoing and needs to be immediately addressed, the governance group may take appropriate action to ensure the safety of everyone involved. If the situation requires it, this may take the form of a referral to an appropriate non-Fastly agency, including the local police. Fastly is not equipped to handle emergency situations.

If the incident is less urgent, the report will be discussed by the governance group to determine an appropriate response.

## Acknowledge the report

Reporters should receive an emailed acknowledgment of the receipt of their report within 24 hours. Upon receipt of the report, any group members with a conflict of interest will immediately recuse themselves from discussions.

### Conflict of interest policy

Examples of conflicts of interest include:

 * The reporter or reported person is your manager or direct report.
 * You are related to, are romantically connected with, or have a close platonic relationship with either the reporter or the reported person. 
 * The reporter or reported person is someone you work closely with. This could be someone on your team or someone who works on the same project as you.
 * The reporter or reported person is a maintainer who regularly reviews your contributions.

Governance group members do not need to state why they have a conflict of interest, only that one exists. Other group members should not ask why the person has a conflict of interest.

Anyone who has a conflict of interest will remove themselves from the discussion of the incident, and recuse themselves from voting on a response to the report.

## Evaluating a report

The Fastly OSS governance group will consider the following questions in considering the validity and severity of the report.

### Jurisdiction

 * *Is this a Code of Conduct violation?* Is this behavior on our list of inappropriate behavior? Is it borderline inappropriate behavior? Does it violate our community norms?
 * *Did this occur in a space that is within our Code of Conduct’s scope?* If the incident occurred outside the community, but a community member’s mental health or physical safety may be negatively impacted if no action is taken, the incident may be in scope. Private conversations in community spaces are also in scope.

### Impact

 * *Did this incident occur in a private conversation or in a public space?* Incidents that all community members can see will have a more negative impact.
 * *Does this behavior negatively impact a marginalized group in our community?* Is the reporter a person from a marginalized group in our community? How is the reporter being negatively impacted by the reported person’s behavior? Are members of the marginalized group likely to disengage with the community if no action was taken on this report?
 * *Does this incident involve a community leader?* Community members often look up to community leaders to set the standard of acceptable behavior.

### Risk

 * *Does this incident include sexual harassment?*
 * *Does this pose a safety risk?* Does the behavior put a person’s physical safety at risk? Will this incident severely negatively impact someone’s mental health?
 * *Is there a risk of this behavior being repeated?* Does the reported person understand why their behavior was inappropriate? Is there an established pattern of behavior from past reports?

Reports which involve higher risk or higher impact may face more severe consequences than reports which involve lower risk or lower impact.

## Propose actions and consequences

The group will determine a concrete behavioral modification plan that ensures the inappropriate behavior is not repeated.  The group will also discuss what actions may need to be taken if the reported person does not agree to the behavioral modification plan.

What follows are examples of possible actions and consequences for incidents that occur in spaces under the scope of the Code of Conduct. This list is not comprehensive, and the Fastly OSS governance group reserves the right to take any action it deems necessary. For example:

 * Nothing, if the behavior was determined to not be a Code of Conduct violation
 * A verbal or emailed warning
 * Requiring that the reported person not use specific language
 * Requiring that the reported person not join in on specific types of discussions
 * Requiring that the reported person not send private messages to a specific community member
 * Requiring that the reported person not join specific communication channels
 * Reducing, restricting or removing access rights held by the reported person
 * Relieving the reported person of some or all of their duties and responsibilities within the community
 * Publishing an account of the incident

## Group vote

Some group members may have a [conflict of interest](#todo) and may be excluded from discussions of a particular incident report. Excluding those members, decisions on the behavioral modification plans and consequences will be determined by a two-thirds majority vote of the Fastly OSS governance group. The quorum for a minimum number of participating group members in an incident (due to availability and exclusions for conflicts of interest) is three, though in cases where the number is exactly three, the decision must be unanimous.

## Follow up with the reported person

The Fastly OSS governance group will draft a response to the reported person. The email should contain:

 * A description of the person’s behavior in neutral language
 * The negative impact of that behavior
 * A concrete behavioral modification plan
 * Any consequences of their behavior

The group should not state who reported this incident. They should attempt to anonymize any identifying information from the report. The reported person should be discouraged from contacting the reporter to discuss the report. If they wish to apologize to the reporter, the group can accept the apology on behalf of the reporter and relay it if they feel it’s appropriate to do so.

## Decide further responses

If the reported person provides additional context, the Fastly OSS governance group may need to re-evaluate the behavioral modification plan and consequences.

## Follow up with the reporter

A person who makes a report should receive a follow-up email stating what action was taken in response to the report. If the group decided no response was needed, they should provide an email explaining why it was not a Code of Conduct violation. Reports that are not made in good faith (such as “reverse sexism” or “reverse racism”) may receive no response.

The follow-up email should be sent no later than one week after the receipt of the report. If deliberation or follow-up with the reported person takes longer than one week, the group should send a status email to the reporter.

## Privacy and data retention

Information and discussion relating to reports may exist in email systems and group chat channels accessible only to members of the OSS governance group and the advisory group as appropriate. Where a governance group member recuses themselves due to a conflict of interest, they will not have access to any information about a report. New members of the governance group do not have access to discussions or reports that existed prior to their joining.
