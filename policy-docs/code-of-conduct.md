Fastly’s community is made up of builders at the cutting edge, dreamers who create technology that people all over the world enjoy or rely on every day. As such, we believe it’s our responsibility to nurture, protect, and inspire everyone who builds on or interacts with Fastly’s technology. What’s more, we believe the experience of building and using the internet is better when our community is open, inclusive, friendly, and trustworthy. This Code of Conduct outlines how we expect people to behave in Fastly’s community so we can build the future of the web — together.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies anywhere you’re in a Fastly-administered space, digital or physical, or in the context of a Fastly-affiliated project. It applies to all community members, whether they are Fastly employees or not. 

## Our community

Members of the Fastly community are **open, inclusive, friendly, and respectful**. Behaviors that reinforce these values contribute to a positive environment and include:

 * **Being open.** Members of the community are open to collaboration.
 * **Focusing on what is best for the community.** We’re respectful of the processes set forth in the community, and we work within them.
 * **Acknowledging time and effort.** We're respectful of volunteer efforts. We’re thoughtful when addressing the efforts of others, keeping in mind that often the labor is donated for the good of the community.
 * **Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.** We’re receptive to constructive comments and criticism, as the experiences and skill sets of other members contribute to the whole of our efforts.
 * **Showing empathy towards other community members.** We’re attentive in our communications, whether in person or online, and we’re tactful when approaching differing views.
 * **Being considerate.** Members of the community are considerate of their peers, Fastly employees, and other Fastly users.
 * **Being respectful.** We’re respectful of others, their positions, their skills, their commitments, and their efforts.
 * **Gracefully accepting constructive criticism.** When we disagree, we are courteous in raising our issues.
 * **Using welcoming and inclusive language.** We’re accepting of all who wish to take part in our activities, fostering an environment where anyone can participate and everyone can make a difference.


## Our standards

Every member of our community has the right to have their identity respected. The Fastly OSS governance group is dedicated to providing a positive experience for everyone, regardless of age, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, ethnicity, nationality, race, religion (or lack thereof), education, or socio-economic status.


### Inappropriate behavior

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

 * Harassment of any participants in any form
 * Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following
 * Logging or taking screenshots of online activity for harassment purposes
 * Publishing others’ private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
 * Violent threats or language directed against another person

 * Creating additional online accounts in order to harass another person or circumvent a ban

 * Pattern of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/ assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with others
 * Sustained disruption of online community discussions, in-person presentations, or other in-person events

## How we handle reports

The Fastly OSS governance group will receive and evaluate incident reports from the online communities listed above. In cases where the group disagrees on the suggested resolution for a report, they may choose to defer to Fastly executive leadership. 

If a participant engages in behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, the Fastly OSS governance group may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the community and community events with no refund of event tickets or other participation fees.
